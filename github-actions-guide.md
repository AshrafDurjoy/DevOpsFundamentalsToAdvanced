# Understanding GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

This guide explains the core concepts of GitHub Actions CI/CD using our Solar System application workflow as a real-world example.

## 1. Introduction to CI/CD

### What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. Each integration is verified by automated tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

**Continuous Delivery (CD)** extends CI by automatically deploying all code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage.

### Benefits of CI/CD

- **Faster development cycles**: Automation reduces manual work
- **Higher quality code**: Regular testing catches bugs early
- **More reliable deployments**: Consistent, repeatable deployment process
- **Faster feedback**: Developers know immediately if changes break the application
- **Reduced risk**: Small, incremental changes are easier to troubleshoot

## 2. GitHub Actions Fundamentals

### What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly in your repository.

### Key Components

1. **Workflows**: YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory that define your automation
2. **Events**: Triggers that start a workflow (e.g., push, pull request)
3. **Jobs**: A set of steps that execute on the same runner
4. **Steps**: Individual tasks that run commands or actions
5. **Actions**: Reusable units of code for common tasks
6. **Runners**: Servers that run your workflows

### Anatomy of a workflow file

```yaml
name: Workflow Name

on:                    # Triggers that start the workflow
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:                  # Collection of jobs to run
  build:               # Job name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Environment to run the job on
    
    steps:             # Collection of steps in the job
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Action to use
      
      - name: Run a command         # Step name
        run: echo "Hello, world!"   # Command to run
```

## 3. Solar System CI/CD Pipeline Explained

Our Solar System application workflow (`solar-system-ec2.yml`) demonstrates a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with several jobs:

1. **Debugging & Testing**: Verifies credentials and runs application tests
2. **Docker Image Building**: Creates a container for our application
3. **Infrastructure Setup**: Provisions AWS resources (DynamoDB, IAM roles)
4. **EC2 Provisioning**: Creates a virtual machine to run our application
5. **Deployment**: Deploys the application to the EC2 instance

### Workflow Trigger Configuration

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ['*']  # Run on any branch push
    paths-ignore:     # Don't run for documentation changes
      - '**.md'
      - 'docs/**'
  pull_request:      # Also run for pull requests
    branches: [main, develop, master]
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggering
    inputs:          # Configurable parameters for manual runs
      environment:
        description: 'Target environment'
        required: true
        default: 'development'
        type: choice
        options:
          - development
          - production
```

This configuration shows how to:
- Run on specific events (push, pull request)
- Filter by branch or path
- Enable manual triggers with custom inputs

## 4. Jobs and Steps Breakdown

### 4.1. Debug Job

```yaml
debug:
  name: Debug Workflow Environment
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Display workflow context
      run: |
        echo "Branch: ${{ github.ref }}"
        echo "Event name: ${{ github.event_name }}"
        # Additional debugging information
```

**Purpose**: Validates the environment and ensures all required secrets are available before proceeding.

**Key lessons**:
- Using environment variables and GitHub context
- Secret detection (checking existence without exposing values)
- Conditional execution preparation

### 4.2. Test Job

The test job includes several steps:
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Node.js
3. Install dependencies
4. Create mock test environment
5. Run tests
6. Generate code coverage

**Key lessons**:
- Setting up a development environment
- Using actions (checkout, setup-node)
- Mocking dependencies for isolated testing
- Generating artifacts (test results, coverage reports)

### 4.3. Docker Build Job

```yaml
build-docker:
  name: Build Docker Image
  needs: test  # This job depends on the test job
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  # Additional steps that build and push the Docker image
```

**Key lessons**:
- Job dependencies with `needs` keyword
- Working with Docker in GitHub Actions
- Container registry integration
- Caching strategies for faster builds

### 4.4. AWS Resource Setup Jobs

Our workflow includes multiple jobs that set up AWS resources:
- `setup-dynamodb`: Creates and populates a DynamoDB table
- `setup-ec2-role`: Creates IAM roles and policies
- `provision-ec2`: Creates an EC2 instance using CloudFormation

**Key lessons**:
- Cloud resource provisioning automation
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Using AWS CLI in GitHub Actions
- Waiting for resources to be ready before proceeding

### 4.5. Deployment Job

The final job deploys the application to the EC2 instance:

```yaml
deploy-to-ec2:
  name: Deploy to EC2 Instance
  needs: [build-docker, setup-dynamodb, setup-ec2-role, provision-ec2]
  # Steps to deploy the Docker image to EC2
```

**Key lessons**:
- Multi-dependency job setup
- SSH deployment techniques
- Environment configuration
- Docker container deployment
- Deployment verification

## 5. Advanced Workflow Features

### 5.1. Conditional Execution

```yaml
if: |
  contains(github.ref, 'workflow') ||
  github.event.inputs.demo-mode == 'true' || 
  (github.event.inputs.setup-dynamodb != false && github.event_name != 'pull_request')
```

This pattern lets us control when steps or jobs run based on:
- Which branch we're on
- Manual input parameters
- Event types
- Environment variables

### 5.2. Outputs and Job Communication

```yaml
outputs:
  image-tag: ${{ steps.set-image-tag.outputs.image-tag }}
```

Jobs can pass data to other jobs, enabling complex workflows where one job's result affects others.

### 5.3. Environment Configuration

```yaml
environment:
  name: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment || 'development' }}
  url: ${{ steps.deploy-details.outputs.app-url }}
```

GitHub Environments provide:
- Deployment protection rules
- Environment-specific secrets
- Deployment history tracking
- URL links to deployed applications

## 6. CI/CD Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Fail Fast**: Tests run before resource provisioning or deployment
2. **Idempotent Operations**: Scripts check if resources exist before creating
3. **Environment Separation**: Development vs. production environments
4. **Security**: Secured secrets and credentials management
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests and mock testing before deployment
6. **Self-Documenting Workflows**: Clear job and step names
7. **Error Handling**: Proper exit codes and error reporting
8. **Artifacts**: Test results and logs are preserved

## 7. Hands-on Exercises

### Exercise 1: Add a Linting Step

Add a step to the test job that runs a linter (like ESLint) to check code quality:

```yaml
- name: Run linting
  run: |
    npm install eslint
    npx eslint .
```

### Exercise 2: Add a Notification Step

Add a step that sends a Slack message or email when deployment completes:

```yaml
- name: Send notification
  if: always()  # Run even if previous steps failed
  uses: someSlackNotificationAction@v1
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

### Exercise 3: Add a Rollback Strategy

Implement a rollback strategy that reverts to the previous version if deployment fails.

## 8. Common GitHub Actions Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Possible Causes | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Secrets not available | Missing/misspelled secrets | Check secret names and add missing secrets |
| Docker build fails | Missing Dockerfile or context | Verify Dockerfile path and content |
| AWS permissions issue | Insufficient IAM permissions | Check IAM policy and add required permissions |
| Tests failing | Code issues or environment problems | Debug with the test logs and fix issues |
| SSH connection failure | Key format or security group issues | Verify key format and EC2 security group rules |

## 9. GitHub Actions Limitations

1. **Job runtime**: Maximum of 6 hours per job
2. **Storage**: Limited storage for artifacts (500MB-5GB depending on plan)
3. **Concurrency**: Limits on concurrent jobs
4. **API Rate Limits**: GitHub API calls are rate-limited
5. **Public Runners**: Limited resources on GitHub-hosted runners
